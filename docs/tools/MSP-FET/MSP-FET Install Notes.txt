Thought I'd include my trials and tribulations with Keith as he'll run into this too. The 
MSP-FET debugger is working on my Windows 7 but is still misbehaving on my Windows 10 
laptop (but gets further it just complains the target isn't plugged in when it is).

It seems to get stuck very easily when switching back and forth between computers but on 
Windows 7 I can now recover without rebooting Windows with the following: unplug the 
MSP-FET pod from the target. Then unplug the MSP-FET pod from the PC until the USB manager 
beeps and removes the device.

Plug the MSP-FET pod back in to the PC and two serial ports will appear on PC. Now plug 
in the target cable into the MSP-FET pod and you should be able to use CCS to load and run.

Steps to get it working included: 
1. I ran the installCerts.bat file that comes with the CDC driver 
(see c:\ti\ccsv8\ccs_base\emulation\drivers\msp430\USB_CDC directory).

2. I connected just the MSP-FET to the PC and ran the debugger. The PC should see the two 
serial ports and then I ran the debugger (still no target connected).

3. The debugger will complain about the pod's firmware and give you a chance to upgrade it. 
You will need to repeat step 2 and 3 at least twice I did it 3 times before it settled down.

4. Once the debugger is happy it will fail because there's no target, so I cancelled out 
connected the target and than ran the debugger again... and it worked.

I did try to run the INF file in the USB_CDC directory at least 10 different ways with no 
visible success, so its possible that had some effect but it looked none of those attempts 
managed to install anything so the original USB_CDC driver install with the IDE is probably 
the one that's currently running.

After it was working I did get a communication error similar to the Launchpad error and had 
to reboot Windows but since than its been okay other than the little trick I mentioned at 
the beginning to deal with switching PCs.
