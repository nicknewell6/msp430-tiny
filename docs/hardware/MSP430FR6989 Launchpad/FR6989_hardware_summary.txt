Serial port access
------------------

- Use the device manager to find the PC port created (I was com33)

- On the target MSP430FR6989 side, the backchannel is connected to the eUSCI_A1 module. The eZ-FET
    has a configurable baud rate; therefore, it is important that the PC application configures the baud rate to
    be the same as what is configured on the eUSCI_A1.
    
- The eZ-FET also supports hardware flow control, if desired. Hardware flow control (CTS and RTS
    handshaking) allows the target MSP430FR6989 and the emulator to tell each other to wait before sending
    more data. At low baud rates and with simple target applications, flow control may not be necessary.
    Applications with higher baud rates and more interrupts to service have a higher likelihood that the will not
    be able to read the eUSCI_A1 RXBUF register in time, before the next byte arrives. If this happens, the
    eUSCI_A1 UCA1STATW register reports an overrun error.
